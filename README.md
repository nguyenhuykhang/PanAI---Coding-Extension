## Inspiration
As a College student and a software developer, I spend a lot of time trying to find the problems in my program. As always, I had to search for the solutions, toggling between tabs, but it turned out that I just missed a square bracket in a thousand lines of code. In my CSE232 course at Michigan State University, C++ syntax is much more complicated and students often forget to add brackets and necessary libraries, resulting in time-consuming setbacks in their coding tasks. Moreover, coding standards and conventions are things that I put in my priority. Therefore, with the help of Pan-Coding Buddy IDE Extension, users can simplify the coding experience, empower developers, and contribute something innovative to the developer tools landscape.

## What it does
Pan provides a range of intelligent features and tools within the integrated development environment (IDE)
- Intelligent Buddy: integrate a chatbot in the left panel to ask questions and provide real-time support
- Customized Menu: highly customized shortcut menu in the Right Click with default options: 
- Amazing Coding Flow: Implement Follow-Up Questions for Seamless Conversation Flow
- Documentation Integration: Pan seamlessly integrates documentation, allowing developers to access explanations and examples without leaving the IDE.
- Interactive Code Editor:  Insert code snippets from the AI's response into the active editor by selecting the designated option for incorporating them.

## Challenges we ran into
- Integration Complexity: Integrating Pan seamlessly into various IDE environments required meticulous attention to compatibility and extensive testing.
- Performance Optimization: Optimal performance demands careful resource management and continuous optimization efforts.
- Natural Language Processing: The complexities of natural language processing require me to ensure accurate responses and context understanding.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our achievement lies in developing a feature-rich toolset, including syntax highlighting, code suggestions, debugging assistance, and documentation integration, all optimized for fast and responsive performance. We've successfully implemented robust natural language processing capabilities, enabling real-time assistance within the IDE. Additionally, our user-centric design approach has resulted in an intuitive interface that enhances the coding experience.

## What we learned
We learn a lot about how to integrate modern technology to enhance the coding experience while following coding conventions and standards. This experience enhanced our understanding of software development and underscored the importance of prioritizing user experience and flexibility in the development process.

## What's next for Coding Buddy IDE Extension
The next steps include adding customization options for user shortcuts, optimizing prompt examples for efficiency, and tailoring knowledge specifically for Michigan State University students in various courses. Our goal is to empower users with greater control over their coding experience while providing more effective assistance and support tailored to their needs.
